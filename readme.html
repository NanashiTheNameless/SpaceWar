      <a href="https://spacewar.oversigma.com/">This code was pulled from https://spacewar.oversigma.com/ and heavily
        modernized!</a>
      <br>
      <br>
      Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell, and
      Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by Stephen
      Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz, together with Alan
      Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders.
      Spacewar! is in the public domain, but this credit paragraph must
      accompany all distributed versions of the program.

    <p>This is the original version! Martin Graetz provided us with a printed version of the source. We typed in in
      again - it was about 40 pages long - and re-assembled it with a PDP-1 assembler written in PERL. The resulting
      binary runs in a PDP-1 emulator written in JavaScript. The code is extremely faithful to the original. There are
      only two changes. 1)The spaceships have been made bigger and 2) The overall timing has been special cased to deal
      with varying machine speeds. </p>
    <p>The original sources are available in <a href="originsources.zip">originsources.zip</a>.
    <p>My Custom sources are available on <a href="https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/SpaceWar/">my GitHub</a>.
    <p>The older Java version is in a subdirectory called "java".

    <p>The "w", "a", "s", "d" keys control one of the spaceships. The "i", "j", "k", "l" keys control the other. 
      The controls are shoot, spin left, thrust, spin right.</p>
